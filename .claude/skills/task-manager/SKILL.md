# Task Manager Skill v2.0.0

Automates the complete task lifecycle for migration CLI development: selection, context loading, implementation guidance, quality validation, and completion tracking.

## Version History

- **v2.0.0** (2025-11-07): Script-based selection (95% token savings), multi-file task support, corrected task format parsing
- **v1.0.0** (2025-10-01): Initial release with TASKS.md-based selection

## When to Use This Skill

Claude should **automatically** invoke this skill when the user:

- Asks to "start the next task" or "what should I work on next"
- Requests "show me the next ready task" or "list ready tasks"
- Says "I'm ready to begin" or "what's next?"
- Mentions a specific task ID like "start T0001" or "work on T0002"
- Asks "what tasks are ready?" or "show task queue"
- Says "mark task X as done" or "complete T0001"
- Requests task status updates or progress reports

## Core Capabilities

### 1. **Task Discovery & Selection**

- Scans `docs/tasks/` directory for task files matching `T####-*.md` pattern
- Identifies tasks with `status: READY` in YAML frontmatter
- Prioritizes by: P0 (critical path) > P1 > P2 > P3
- Validates all dependencies are completed
- Handles optional task ID argument for direct selection

### 2. **Context Loading**

- **Parse YAML frontmatter**:
  - `id`: Task identifier (e.g., T0001)
  - `title`: Task description
  - `priority`: P0/P1/P2/P3
  - `component`: Component code (e.g., C01)
  - `status`: TODO/READY/IN_PROGRESS/DONE
  - `created`: Timestamp
  - `source`: Origin document reference

- **Extract markdown sections**:
  - Description: Problem statement and context
  - Acceptance Criteria: Checkboxes for validation
  - Implementation Steps: Ordered remediation sequence
  - Files to Change: Create/Modify/Delete lists
  - Testing Requirements: Test matrix with AC mapping
  - Dependencies: Blocking/Blocked By relationships
  - Regression Risk: Impact analysis and blast radius
  - Code Examples: Current vs Proposed code
  - Notes: Additional context and related issues

### 3. **Implementation Guidance**

- Provides step-by-step implementation plan from task file
- **Enforces Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach using Wallaby MCP tools:
  - Read test requirements from task's Testing Requirements section
  - Guide user through writing tests FIRST (unit → integration → E2E)
  - Use `mcp__wallaby__wallaby_failingTests` to verify red state
  - Use `mcp__wallaby__wallaby_testById` to monitor test progress
  - Use `mcp__wallaby__wallaby_coveredLinesForFile` to check coverage
  - Only implement code AFTER tests are written
- Extracts code examples from task file (Current vs Proposed)
- Applies TypeScript quality patterns from `.claude/rules/typescript-patterns-condensed.md`
- Identifies files to create/modify/delete

### 4. **Quality Validation**

- Runs type checking (`pnpm typecheck`)
- Executes linting (`pnpm lint`)
- Runs test suite (`pnpm test`)
- Checks formatting (`pnpm format:check`)
- Validates all acceptance criteria are checked

### 5. **Task Lifecycle Management**

- Updates task file status: TODO → READY → IN_PROGRESS → DONE
- Marks dependencies complete in frontmatter
- Unblocks dependent tasks (updates their status to READY)
- Tracks completion statistics
- Adds completion timestamps to task files

## Supporting Documentation

- **@README.md**: Quick reference and usage examples
- **@SELECTION.md**: Fallback algorithm details (only if script fails)
- **@IMPLEMENTATION.md**: TDD guidance and implementation patterns
- **@VALIDATION.md**: Quality check procedures and completion criteria
- **@ERROR_HANDLING.md**: Error scenarios and resolution strategies
- **@EXAMPLES.md**: Detailed interaction examples

## Main Workflow

Follow this systematic process:

### Phase 1: Select Task (Script-Based - 95% Token Savings)

**⚡ ALWAYS use the script first** to save ~2000 tokens:

```bash
# From project root directory
cd /Users/nathanvale/code/MPCU-Build-and-Deliver

# Select next ready task (auto-priority: P0 > P1 > P2 > P3)
bun ~/.claude/skills/task-manager/select-task.ts

# Select specific task by ID
bun ~/.claude/skills/task-manager/select-task.ts --task-id=T0001

# List all ready tasks
bun ~/.claude/skills/task-manager/select-task.ts --show-ready
```

**Expected Output** (structured JSON ~100 tokens):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task": {
    "id": "T0001",
    "title": "Fix query execution error in ContactRepository.findByName()",
    "priority": "P0",
    "status": "READY",
    "component": "C01",
    "filePath": "docs/tasks/T0001-fix-query-execution-error-findbyname.md",
    "created": "2025-11-07T00:00:00Z",
    "source": "docs/bugs/2025-11-07-migration-contact-creation-failure-100-percent.md"
  },
  "readyTasks": [
    {"id": "T0001", "priority": "P0", "title": "..."},
    {"id": "T0003", "priority": "P1", "title": "..."}
  ]
}
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Only read @SELECTION.md if the script fails or returns an error.

---

### Phase 2: Load Context

**Read the complete task file** using the `filePath` from script output:

```bash
# Read task file
cat docs/tasks/T0001-fix-query-execution-error-findbyname.md
```

**Display to user:**

1. **Task summary** (from frontmatter):
   - ID, priority, component, status
   - Created date, source document

2. **Description section**:
   - Problem statement
   - Error details
   - Root cause analysis

3. **Acceptance Criteria** (as checklist):
   ```
   - [ ] Mock query() returns empty array [] when no contacts match filter
   - [ ] findByName() returns null when no contacts found
   - [ ] Filter string parsing handles special characters safely
   - [ ] All 100 test CSV rows process successfully
   - [ ] Integration test validates mock query behavior
   ```

4. **Testing Requirements** (test matrix):
   - List all required tests with type, description, and location
   - Map tests to acceptance criteria they validate
   - Show TDD order: unit → integration → E2E

5. **Regression Risk section**:
   - Impact level and blast radius
   - Testing gaps identified
   - Rollback risk assessment

6. **Implementation Steps** (ordered sequence):
   - Extract numbered steps from task file
   - Show file references and line numbers
   - Include code change descriptions

7. **Files to Change section**:
   - Files to Create (list)
   - Files to Modify (with line ranges)
   - Files to Delete (list)

8. **Code Examples section**:
   - Current (Problematic) code
   - Proposed (Fixed) code
   - Highlight key differences

9. **Dependencies**:
   - Blocking: Tasks that block this one
   - Blocked By: Tasks this one blocks

10. **Notes section**:
    - Related issues/tasks
    - Investigation findings
    - Testing strategy
    - Future improvements

**Read related documents** referenced in `source` field or Notes section.

### Phase 3: Guide Implementation

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Read @IMPLEMENTATION.md for complete TDD guidance before proceeding.

**Key principles:**

1. **Extract implementation plan** from task's Implementation Steps section
2. **Enforce TDD workflow** by STRICTLY following the test matrix:
   - Parse Testing Requirements table from task file
   - **Write tests FIRST** (never code before tests):
     ```bash
     # Check current test status
     bun ~/.claude/skills/task-manager/check-tests.ts T0001

     # Verify tests are failing (RED state)
     # Use Wallaby MCP: mcp__wallaby__wallaby_failingTests
     ```
   - Write unit tests first, then integration tests, then E2E
   - Verify each test fails before implementing (RED)
   - Implement code to make tests pass (GREEN)
   - Refactor while keeping tests green (REFACTOR)
3. **Extract code examples** from task file's Code Examples section
4. **Apply TypeScript quality patterns** from `.claude/rules/typescript-patterns-condensed.md`
5. **Use Wallaby MCP tools** throughout:
   - Monitor test execution in real-time
   - Check code coverage as you implement
   - Identify failing tests that need attention

---

### Phase 4: Confirm & Start

1. **Present implementation summary**:
   - What will be done (from Implementation Steps)
   - Files affected (from Files to Change)
   - Test strategy (from Testing Requirements)
   - Estimated effort (from frontmatter)

2. **Wait for user confirmation** ("yes", "proceed", "go ahead")

3. **CRITICAL - Update task status**:
   ```bash
   # Update status: READY → IN_PROGRESS
   # Edit docs/tasks/T####-*.md frontmatter
   ```

4. **Begin implementation** with user (TDD approach)

---

### Phase 5: Track Progress

**During implementation:**

1. **Guide through test creation** (TDD approach):
   - Unit tests first
   - Integration tests second
   - E2E tests last
   - Verify RED state before implementing

2. **Guide through code implementation**:
   - Implement to make tests pass (GREEN)
   - Refactor while tests stay green
   - Follow code examples from task file

3. **Check off acceptance criteria** as completed:
   - Update task file with checked items
   - Track progress visually for user

4. **Monitor test status** with Wallaby MCP:
   ```bash
   # Check failing tests
   mcp__wallaby__wallaby_failingTests

   # Check specific test
   mcp__wallaby__wallaby_testById --id="test-id"

   # Check coverage
   mcp__wallaby__wallaby_coveredLinesForFile --file="path/to/file.ts"
   ```

5. **Keep user informed** of remaining items and blockers

---

### Phase 6: Validate & Complete

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Read @VALIDATION.md for complete quality check procedures.

**Required checks (ALL must pass):**

```bash
# 1. Type checking
pnpm typecheck
# Expected: 0 errors

# 2. Linting
pnpm lint
# Expected: 0 errors

# 3. Test suite
pnpm test
# Expected: All tests passing

# 4. Formatting
pnpm format:check
# Expected: 0 errors
```

**Only after ALL checks pass:**

1. **Verify all acceptance criteria checked** in task file
2. **Update task status**: IN_PROGRESS → DONE
   ```bash
   # Edit docs/tasks/T####-*.md
   # Change status: DONE
   # Add completion timestamp
   ```
3. **Unblock dependent tasks**:
   - Find tasks blocked by this one (from Dependencies)
   - Update their status: TODO → READY (if all dependencies done)
4. **Report completion statistics**:
   - Time taken
   - Files modified
   - Tests added/updated
   - Coverage improvement
5. **Recommend next task** on critical path (P0 tasks first)

---

## Critical Rules

**NEVER skip these steps:**

- ✅ **ALWAYS** run the script first (Phase 1) - do NOT read @SELECTION.md unless script fails
- ✅ **ALWAYS** verify ALL dependencies are DONE before starting
- ✅ **ALWAYS** read complete task file (all sections) before implementation
- ✅ **ALWAYS** enforce TDD: write tests FIRST, verify RED, then implement GREEN
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use Wallaby MCP tools to monitor test progress
- ✅ **ALWAYS** update task file status when changing phases
- ✅ **ALWAYS** run ALL quality checks before marking DONE
- ✅ **ALWAYS** unblock dependent tasks after completion
- ✅ **ALWAYS** follow TypeScript patterns from `.claude/rules/typescript-patterns-condensed.md`

**Task Status Flow:**

```
TODO → READY → IN_PROGRESS → DONE
```

**Priority Order:**

```
P0 (critical path) → P1 → P2 → P3
```

**TDD Cycle (Mandatory):**

```
Write Test (RED) → Implement Code (GREEN) → Refactor (keep GREEN)
```

---

## Error Scenarios

**For detailed error handling**, see: **@ERROR_HANDLING.md**

Common errors:

- Script execution failures → Read @SELECTION.md for fallback
- Task file not found → List available tasks in docs/tasks/
- Dependencies not met → Show blocking tasks and their status
- Task already in progress → Present options (continue/restart)
- No ready tasks → Analyze blockers and suggest next actions
- Quality checks fail → Show errors and guide fixes
- Tests not written first → Enforce TDD, reject code-first approach

---

## Success Metrics

After using this skill, user should have:

- ✅ Clear understanding of what to build
- ✅ Step-by-step implementation plan extracted from task file
- ✅ Test-first development approach (TDD enforced)
- ✅ Real-time test monitoring with Wallaby MCP
- ✅ Quality checks passing before completion
- ✅ Visibility into what tasks are unblocked
- ✅ Seamless transition to next task

---

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works well with:

- **Code Review Skills**: For validating implementation quality
- **Testing Skills**: For comprehensive test coverage
- **Refactoring Skills**: For code quality improvements
- **Documentation Skills**: For updating specs/docs after completion
- **Wallaby MCP**: For real-time test execution and coverage monitoring
