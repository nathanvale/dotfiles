ðŸ“‹ Write a task list that we can work through to implement the following:

$ARGUMENTS

Create a markdown checklist where each checkbox represents a task that we can implement and commit on its own. Think hard about the plan.

Arrange the tasks in the order we need to implement them, not in order of importance.

Example format:
- [ ] Add a test case for feature ABC.
   - It's ok for the test to be failing at this point.
- [ ] Implement feature ABC.
- [ ] Delete DEF
   - Replace usages of DEF with ABC.

Run `mkdir .llm`
Write the plan into `.llm/todo.md`
