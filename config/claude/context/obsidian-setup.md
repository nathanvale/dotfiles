# Obsidian + PARA Setup

My Obsidian vault is my external brain - all key information about my life, projects, and what I'm doing lives there.

## Organization: PARA Method

```
00_Inbox/     → Unprocessed captures (48h max)
01_Projects/  → Has end date, goal-oriented
02_Areas/     → Ongoing responsibilities, NO end date
03_Resources/ → Reference material, interests
04_Archive/   → Completed/cancelled items
```

## Workflow: CODE Method

Capture → Organize → Distill → Express

## Plugin Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/para-brain:capture` | Quick capture to inbox |
| `/para-brain:search` | Search vault with PARA context |
| `/para-brain:process` | Process inbox items |
| `/para-brain:create` | Create new PARA note |
| `/para-brain:review` | Weekly review workflow |
