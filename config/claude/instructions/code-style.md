- Don't write forgiving code
  - Don't permit multiple input formats
    - In TypeScript, this means avoiding Union Type (the `|` in types)
  - Use preconditions
    - Use schema libraries
    - Assert that inputs match expected formats
    - When expectations are violated, throw, don't log
  - Don't add defensive try/catch blocks
    - Usually we let exceptions propagate out
- Don't use abbreviations or acronyms
  - Choose `number` instead of `num` and `greaterThan` instead of `gt`
- Emoji and unicode characters are welcome
  - Use them at the beginning of comments, commit messages, and in headers in docs
