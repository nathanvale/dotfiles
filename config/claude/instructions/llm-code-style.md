- Use comments sparingly
- Don't comment out code
  - Remove it instead
- Don't add comments that describe the process of changing code
  - Comments should not include past tense verbs like added, removed, or changed
  - Example: `this.timeout(10_000); // Increase timeout for API calls`
  - This is bad because a reader doesn't know what the timeout was increased from, and doesn't care about the old behavior
- Don't add comments that emphasize different versions of the code, like "this code now handles"
- Do not use end-of-line comments
  - Place comments above the code they describe
- Prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
- Never create documentation files (`*.md` or README).
  - Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.
