- Extra context for LLMs may be stored in the `.llm/` directory
  - If `.llm/` exists, it will be at the root directory of the git repository
  - `.git/info/exclude` includes `/.llm`, so don't `git add` its contents
- Editable context:
  - If `.llm/todo.md` exists, it is the task list we are working on.
  - As you complete tasks, mark the checkboxes as complete, like `- [x] The task`
  - As we work on an implementation, plans will change. Feel free to edit the task list to keep it relevant and in sync with your plans.
- Read-only context:
  - Everything else in the `.llm/` directory is read-only context for the your reference
  - It contains entire git clones for tools we use
  - It contains saved documentation
